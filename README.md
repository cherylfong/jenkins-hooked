## Jenkins Tutorial

### Abstract
When setting sail to integrate Jenkins with GitHub, I found many different ways to go about doing this and also confusing/contradicting information. 

After chewing the cud, I realized that I couldn't be the only person in the world interested in learning how to do this. So I took the extra mile to make my collection of information into this presentable piece. I tried to be unambiguous as possible, making it into a clear cut step by step process. Hopefully, this can help someone out there avoid some sea monsters in their journey.
